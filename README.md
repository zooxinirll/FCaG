# FCaG - IP Information Fetcher

**Author:** LocalHost.07

## Overview

The FCaG is an simple Bash-based tool designed for retrieving detailed information about public IP addresses. This script gathers data from leading services like ipinfo.io and ipgeolocation.io, making it a powerful utility for network administrators, cybersecurity experts, and developers.

FCaG delivers critical information including IP address, hostname, geolocation (city, region, country), organization, ASN (Autonomous System Number), and continent details all in one consolidated report.

## Features

- **Custom Banner:** Start the script with a personalized, visually appealing banner.
- **Simulated Loading:** Animated spinner provides feedback while the script retrieves information.
- **Detailed IP Information:**
  - IP address
  - Hostname
  - City
  - Region
  - Country
  - Coordinates (latitude, longitude)

- **Input Validation:** Ensures that the user inputs a valid IPv4 address before proceeding.

## Installation and Requirements

### Prerequisites

- **Bash Environment:** Ensure you are using a Unix-based shell (Linux, macOS, or Termux on Android).
- **`jq` JSON Processor:** A lightweight tool used to parse JSON API responses.
  - Installation:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install jq
    ```
- **API Key from ipgeolocation.io:** Required for ASN and continent information.
  - [Sign up](https://ipgeolocation.io/signup) for a free API key and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the script with your own.

## Usage

### Clone the Repository

First, download the script using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zooxinirll/FCaG
cd FCaG
chmod +x main.sh
```

### Run the Script

Execute the script using:

```bash
bash main.sh
```

### Input the IP Address

When prompted, enter a valid public IP address:

```bash
Please enter the IP address > 8.8.8.8
```

### Review the Output

The script will output detailed information regarding the IP address provided, including geolocation, ASN, and continent information.

#### Example Output:

```
Please enter the IP address > 8.8.8.8

## Error Handling

- **Invalid IP Format:** If an invalid IP format is entered, the script returns:

  ```
  [!] jq is not installed. Install it with 'sudo apt install jq'.
  ```

## Rate Limits and Best Practices

Both ipinfo.io and ipgeolocation.io provide free-tier API services. Be aware of their rate limits, and consider upgrading to higher-tier plans if you intend to use the script for large-scale data collection.
