# FCaG - IP Information Fetcher

**Author:** LocalHost.07

## Overview

The FCaG (Fetch Comprehensive and Geolocated IP Information) is an advanced Bash-based tool designed for retrieving detailed information about public IP addresses. This script gathers data from leading services like ipinfo.io and ipgeolocation.io, making it a powerful utility for network administrators, cybersecurity experts, and developers.

FCaG delivers critical information including IP address, hostname, geolocation (city, region, country), organization, ASN (Autonomous System Number), and continent detailsâ€”all in one consolidated report.

## Features

- **Custom Banner:** Start the script with a personalized, visually appealing banner.
- **Simulated Loading:** Animated spinner provides feedback while the script retrieves information.
- **Detailed IP Information:**
  - IP address
  - Hostname
  - City
  - Region
  - Country
  - Coordinates (latitude, longitude)
  - Organization
  - Postal code
  - Timezone
  - ASN (Autonomous System Number)
  - Continent name
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that the user inputs a valid IPv4 address before proceeding.

## Installation and Requirements

### Prerequisites

- **Bash Environment:** Ensure you are using a Unix-based shell (Linux, macOS, or Termux on Android).
- **`jq` JSON Processor:** A lightweight tool used to parse JSON API responses.
  - Installation:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install jq
    ```
- **API Key from ipgeolocation.io:** Required for ASN and continent information.
  - [Sign up](https://ipgeolocation.io/signup) for a free API key and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the script with your own.

## Usage

### Clone the Repository

First, download the script using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-link>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Run the Script

Execute the script using:

```bash
bash main.sh
```

### Input the IP Address

When prompted, enter a valid public IP address:

```bash
Please enter the IP address > 8.8.8.8
```

### Review the Output

The script will output detailed information regarding the IP address provided, including geolocation, ASN, and continent information.

#### Example Output:

```
Please enter the IP address > 8.8.8.8
[*] Fetching details for IP: 8.8.8.8...

## Error Handling

- **Invalid IP Format:** If an invalid IP format is entered, the script returns:
  ```
  [!] Invalid IP format! Please enter a valid IP.
  ```

- **Missing `jq`:** If `jq` is not installed, the script prompts the user:
  ```
  [!] jq is not installed. Install it with 'sudo apt install jq'.
  ```

## Rate Limits and Best Practices

Both ipinfo.io and ipgeolocation.io provide free-tier API services. Be aware of their rate limits, and consider upgrading to higher-tier plans if you intend to use the script for large-scale data collection.
